# Make Up Closet

Simple Application developed using `Swift` and `Objective-C`, using UIKIT and Storyboard to organize beauty care items, including makeup, skincare, haircare, and fragrances.

Each item has its own page with cells corresponding to sub-items of these items; the cells have the option to add items you have or remove them.
